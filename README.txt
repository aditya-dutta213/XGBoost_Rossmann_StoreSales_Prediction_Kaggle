# XGBoost Rossmann Store Sales Prediction

This project applies Gradient Boosting Machines, specifically XGBoost, to predict daily sales for Rossmann stores using Python. The process outlined in the notebook includes:

- Downloading and exploring the Kaggle Rossmann Store Sales dataset.
- Preprocessing the data with particular emphasis on handling missing values and feature engineering.
- Implementing and tuning an XGBoost model to optimize predictions.
- Analyzing feature importance to understand which factors most significantly impact sales.
- Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as RMSE and MAE.
